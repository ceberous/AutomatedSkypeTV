#### Improvements
1. I am relying on stdout being initialized. I can get the Pi to launch python scripts on startup no problem, however, they don't seem to initialize stdout for some reason.
2. I have tried many methods of setting up my router to forward port 22 to the Pi's IP. None of them have worked for me, I was hoping weaved.com and their service would work, but it appears to be down at the time being. Any suggestions for setting up remote ssh with rsa keys?
